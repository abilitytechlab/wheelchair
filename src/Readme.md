The packages that were developed in this work are included in this folder. This src folder is a ROS 2 src directory and so must be extracted in a ROS2 workspace.

The following packages are developed currently:
1. sequence_controller
2. lidar_visualization
3. obstacle_detection
4. error_handler

## Sequence Controller
The two main ROS 2 source files are:
1. state_controller.cpp : For step motion mode with pid, run this node
2. state_controller_v2.cpp : For continuous motion mode, run this ROS 2 node
